# Introduction:
We propose a generalizable detection model that can detect novel and unknown/unseen DeepFakes using a supervised contrastive (SupCon) loss. We obtain the highest accuracy of 78.74% using proposed SupCon model and an accuracy of 83.99% with proposed fusion in a true open-set evaluation scenario where the test class is unknown at the training phase.
# Framework:

# How to use:
```
main_supcon.py
main_linear.py
```
Just remember two trains needed to be conducted.

# Download model
Let me check if I have it.
